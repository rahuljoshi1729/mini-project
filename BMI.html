    <p class="class"><em>BMI</em> stands for Body Mass Index. It is a measure of body fat based on a person's weight and height. BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.<br>

        
        BMI is often used as a screening tool to determine if a person's weight may be putting them at risk for health problems. However, it is important to note that BMI is not a perfect measure of body fat and should be interpreted along with other factors such as age, sex, and muscle mass.<br>
        
        Generally,<b>a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered healthy, a BMI between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight, and a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese.</b> However, this can vary depending on the individual's overall health and other factors. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare provider to determine an appropriate and healthy weight range for each individual.</p>
